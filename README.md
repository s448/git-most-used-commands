1. git init: Initializes a new Git repository in the current directory.

3. git commit: Commits changes to the repository, with a message describing the changes.
4. git clone: Creates a copy of a remote repository on your local machine.
5. git pull: Fetches changes from a remote repository and merges them into your local branch.
6. git push: Sends local changes to a remote repository.
7. git status: Shows the current status of the repository, including changes that have not been committed.
8. git branch: Lists all branches in the repository, or creates a new branch.
9. git checkout: Switches to a different branch or commit.
10. git merge: Combines changes from one branch into another.
11. git log: Shows a history of commits in the repository.
12. git remote: Lists the remote repositories associated with the local repository.
